# Adwaita Icon Theme
![Adwaita Icons](src/logo.svg)

## Bugs and Requests
If you're a core GNOME application maintainer and you have an icon need that bridges multiple components or apps, feel free to file a request in the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme/-/issues). If you're an application developer, file a request against the [Icon Development Kit](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/icon-development-kit/-/issues) instead.


## Fullcolor vs symbolic
For an up to date guide on how to use and how to design GNOME style icons, see the [GNOME User Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/icons-and-artwork.html.en).

## Building and Contributing to Adwaita
Symbolic icons are no longer maintained using hand rolled ruby script and inkscape to render them out, but instead shares the same workflow as 3rd party symbolics, the [icon devkit](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/icon-development-kit).

While many legacy symbolics only live as the exported individual SVGS in `Adwaita/scalable/`, the replacements are maintained in `src/symbolic/core.svg`. The contexts are [no longer used](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme/-/issues/73) and all icons go into `actions`. Please refer to the [Devkit guidelines]() on how to structure the metadata.

Do note that no new additions should be made unless very thoroughly discussed. *a-i-t* is the wrong way to reuse icon assets (no API, false promise of stability).

### Recoloring
The color of the icon set is defined at runtime by the gtk theme. Every single icon from the set is actually embedded inside an xml container that has a stylesheet overriding the colors.

There is a couple of things the icon author needs to be aware of and a few things s/he can make use of. The stylesheet is setting the color of the fill for all rectangles and paths. **DO NOT** leave any rectangles or paths with no fill/stroke thinking it's invisible.

Symblic Preview doesn't convert strokes to paths yet, so you need to do it manually for now in Inkscape (`Path -> Stroke to Path`).

Gtk doesn't care about the colors you define for the icon. They are recolored at runtime. If you need portions of icons to have a color, you need to include a `class` attribute to the shape or group and set it to one of the three values below. 

- `warning` - this maps to gtk `@warning_color`
- `error` - maps to `@error_color`
- `success` - maps to `@success_color`
